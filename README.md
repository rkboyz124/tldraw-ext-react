Steps run the project:

1. Run `npm install` inside the main directory and inside `src/client` directory

2. Run `npm run build`

3. Add the dist folder as an extension to the Ext app.

4. Have fun!

For building the project separately:

* run `npm run extBuild` for building the `src/main.ts` file

* run `npm run clientBuild` to build the main react app

* `npm run serve` to serve the files locally (using the dist folder)
